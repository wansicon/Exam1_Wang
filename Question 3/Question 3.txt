Question 3

The E-value decreases exponentially as the score of the match increases. The lower the E-value, or the closer it is to zero, the more "significant" the match is. In this case, the evalue is 3.4 e-178, which is extremely close to zero and is much lower than 1e -50 (One threshold value given in the lecture notes). This means that it has extremly high confidence, the database results is homologous to the one we searched in the NCBI database.
